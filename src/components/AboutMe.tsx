        <p className="text-lg px-2"><br />Hi Jason Reyes here,<br /><br />
        I'm currently residing in Quezon City, Philippines, and employed as a Research and Development Specialist at GMA New Media Inc. This has been my home for 6 years already.<br /><br />
        Apart from programming and learning new technologies, I spend my time traveling, exploring foods, gaming, and investing.<br /><br />
        I believe that each one of us needs to have a natural curiosity as this triggers a hunger for people to learn.</p>
